# Biography

In my six years working in baseball operations, I have been part analyst, administrator, coach, coordinator, and project manager. With the Tampa Bay Rays, I lived the “Moneyball” experience preparing the organization for the MLB Draft. I worked at the intersection of sports and analytics with goal of making the best decisions possible in a constantly changing environment. 

Now that I have a bit more free time, this blog is both an attempt to research and quantify the random ideas and questions that pop into my head, and also a location to document my own personal growth - the books I've read, the decisions I've made (hopefully I can make the mundane stuff somewhat interesting), what works, what doesn't, and what decisions I would do differently if I had a mulligan.
